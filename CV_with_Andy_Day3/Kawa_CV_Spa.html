            <h2 class="summary">About Me</h2>
            <p class="summary">My name is Kawa Manmi, currently living in Coventry. I have ten years lecturing and researching experience at University in mathematical courses and  several scientific computer programming including Matlab, Fortran, Visual Basic, C++ and Python.
            </p>
            <p class="summary">
              I consider my self as a multi skilled person and highly motivated to work with technologies. 
               Therefore, I would like to take advantage of my background to work in the sector that require strong computing  and  coding skills.
            </p>
            <p class="summary">
              Recently, completed an intensive 14-week course, focused on the fundamentals of data science delivered through a combination of interactive group
              learning and home learning tasks. During the course I built strong skills in the manipulation of data using Numpy and Pandas whilst
              being able to visualise the data using Python libraries including matplotlib, Altair and other software packages such as Power BI.
              Home learning tasks for all weeks submitted via GitHub and passed in BCS Foundation Award in What is Machine Learning? V1.0.
             </p>
             <p class="summary">
              I also completed a data analysis Bootcamp (10 weeks), which was 135 hours of study both via instructor lead training and self-directed learning. A level 3 equivalent skill set across the  areas: Data literacy, understanding data driven software. Excel (Ucertify course for Microsoft Excel 2019), PowerBI,  Analysing & interpreting data and Presenting Data.
             </p>
           <p class="summary">
            Currently, attending a web development bootcamp (3 days in a week for 12 weeks, Bath Spa University) and a software development (every Saturday for 8 months, CodeYourFuture).
